# Database-Normalisation

## Introduction
**What is Normalization?**
Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database. Normalization divides the larger table into smaller and links them using relationships.

A large database defined as a single relation may result in data duplication. This repetition of data may result in:
- Wastage and poor utilization of disk space and resources.
- It makes it difficult to maintain and update data as it would involve searching many records in relation.
- The likelihood of errors and inconsistencies increases.
 
**Why do we need Normalization?** 
- Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations.
- Normalization is used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies.
